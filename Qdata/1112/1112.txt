You are given n item's value and label as two integer arrays values and labels. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit.
Your task is to find a subset of items with the maximum sum of their values such that:
The number of items is at most numWanted.
The number of items with the same label is at most useLimit.
Return the maximum sum.
  Example 1:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1
Output: 9
Explanation:
The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items with the sum of values 5 + 3 + 1.
Example 2:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2
Output: 12
Explanation:
The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items with the sum of values 5 + 4 + 3.
Example 3:
Input: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1
Output: 16
Explanation:
The subset chosen is the first and fourth items with the sum of values 9 + 7.
  Constraints:
n == values.length == labels.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 104
1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n
