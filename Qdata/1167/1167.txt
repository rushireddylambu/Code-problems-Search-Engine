You are given an integer n representing an array colors of length n where all elements are set to 0's meaning uncolored. You are also given a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [indexi, colori]. For the ith query:
Set colors[indexi] to colori.
Count adjacent pairs in colors set to the same color (regardless of colori).
Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,2],[1,2],[3,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [0,1,1,0,2]
Explanation:
Initially array colors = [0,0,0,0], where 0 denotes uncolored elements of the array.
After the 1st query colors = [2,0,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
After the 2nd query colors = [2,2,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
After the 3rd query colors = [2,2,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
After the 4th query colors = [2,1,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
After the 5th query colors = [2,1,1,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 2.
Example 2:
Input: n = 1, queries = [[0,100000]]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
After the 1st query colors = [100000]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
  Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= indexi <= n - 1
1 <=  colori <= 105
