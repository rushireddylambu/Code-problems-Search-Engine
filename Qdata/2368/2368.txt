You are given a 1-indexed array nums. Your task is to select a complete subset from nums where every pair of selected indices multiplied is a
perfect square,
. i. e. if you select ai and aj, i * j must be a perfect square.
Return the sum of the complete subset with the maximum sum.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,7,3,5,7,2,4,9]
Output: 16
Explanation:
We select elements at indices 2 and 8 and 2 * 8 is a perfect square.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [8,10,3,8,1,13,7,9,4]
Output: 20
Explanation:
We select elements at indices 1, 4, and 9. 1 * 4, 1 * 9, 4 * 9 are perfect squares.
  Constraints:
1 <= n == nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
