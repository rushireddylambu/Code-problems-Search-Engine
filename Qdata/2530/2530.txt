You are given an integer array receiver of length n and an integer k. n players are playing a ball-passing game.
You choose the starting player, i. The game proceeds as follows: player i passes the ball to player receiver[i], who then passes it to receiver[receiver[i]], and so on, for k passes in total. The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. i + receiver[i] + receiver[receiver[i]] + ... + receiver(k)[i].
Return the maximum possible score.
Notes:
receiver may contain duplicates.
receiver[i] may be equal to i.
  Example 1:
Input: receiver = [2,0,1], k = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
Starting with player i = 2 the initial score is 2:
Pass Sender Index Receiver Index Score
1 2 1 3
2 1 0 3
3 0 2 5
4 2 1 6
Example 2:
Input: receiver = [1,1,1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation:
Starting with player i = 4 the initial score is 4:
Pass Sender Index Receiver Index Score
1 4 3 7
2 3 2 9
3 2 1 10
  Constraints:
1 <= receiver.length == n <= 105
0 <= receiver[i] <= n - 1
1 <= k <= 1010
